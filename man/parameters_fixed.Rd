\arguments{
\item{region}{The region for the parameters, must be either \code{"equateur"},
\code{"sudkivu"}, \code{"burundi"} or \code{"bujumbura"}}

\item{initial_infections}{The initial number of infections}

\item{use_ve_D}{logical, indicating whether model should allow for vaccine
efficacy against death (above and beyond protection against infection)}

\item{mixing_matrix}{The mixing matrix must be either \code{"Zimbabwe"},
\code{"synthetic_home"}, or \code{"synthetic_all"}}

\item{p_SW}{The proportion of SW-age groups that are sex workers. Note that
e.g. a value of 0.01 means 1\% of all SW-age groups are sex workers and not
just 1\% of women in those groups. Default is NULL, in which case we use
the default value for the region given in the package}

\item{p_HCW}{The proportion of HCW-age groups that are healthcare workers.
Default is NULL, in which case we use the default value for the region
given in the package}

\item{overrides}{A list, containing any parameters for which you want to
override the default values}
